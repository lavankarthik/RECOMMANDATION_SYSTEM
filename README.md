##DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on developing a Java-based recommendation engine using Apache Mahout, designed to suggest products based on user preferences and past interactions. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media, improving user experience by providing personalized suggestions. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, a technique that analyzes relationships between users and items to generate relevant recommendations. It processes a dataset (data.csv) containing user ratings for various products and predicts suitable items for a given user. Built using Java, the project integrates Apache Mahout for machine learning-based recommendations and employs Maven for dependency management. The implementation, executed in Eclipse IDE Enterprise, demonstrates the power of data-driven recommendations in enhancing engagement and user satisfaction.
